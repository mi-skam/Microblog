## 2. Architectural & Planning Context

The following are the relevant sections from the architecture and plan documents, which I found by analyzing the task description.

### Context: logging-monitoring (from 05_Operational_Architecture.md)

```markdown
**Logging & Monitoring:**

**Logging Strategy:**
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs for machine processing
- **Log Levels**: DEBUG (dev), INFO (operations), WARN (issues), ERROR (failures)
- **Security Logging**: Failed authentication attempts, CSRF violations
- **Performance Logging**: Build times, API response times, file operations
- **Audit Logging**: Content modifications, user actions, configuration changes

**Log Configuration:**
```python
# Logging setup
LOGGING_CONFIG = {
    "version": 1,
    "formatters": {
        "structured": {
            "format": '{"timestamp": "%(asctime)s", "level": "%(levelname)s", "module": "%(name)s", "message": "%(message)s"}'
        }
    },
    "handlers": {
        "file": {
            "class": "logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler",
            "filename": "microblog.log",
            "maxBytes": 10485760,  # 10MB
            "backupCount": 5
        }
    }
}
```

**Monitoring Capabilities:**
- **Health Checks**: API endpoint for system status verification
- **Build Monitoring**: Track build success/failure rates and durations
- **File System Monitoring**: Disk space usage and permission issues
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, concurrent users, resource usage
- **Error Tracking**: Automatic error aggregation and alerting

**Health Check Endpoint:**
```python
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {
        "status": "healthy",
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "database": check_database_connection(),
        "filesystem": check_filesystem_permissions(),
        "last_build": get_last_build_status()
    }
```
```

### Context: scalability-performance (from 05_Operational_Architecture.md)

```markdown
**Scalability & Performance:**

**Performance Optimization:**
- **Static Content Delivery**: Pre-generated HTML eliminates server processing overhead
- **Efficient File I/O**: Optimized markdown parsing and template rendering
- **Database Optimization**: Single-user SQLite with minimal query complexity
- **Asset Optimization**: Minified CSS and vendored JavaScript for reduced load times
- **Caching Strategy**: Browser caching headers for static content

**Build Performance:**
```python
# Build performance targets
BUILD_PERFORMANCE_TARGETS = {
    "100_posts": "< 5 seconds",
    "1000_posts": "< 30 seconds",
    "markdown_parsing": "< 100ms per file",
    "template_rendering": "< 50ms per page",
    "image_copying": "< 1GB per minute"
}
```

**Scalability Considerations:**
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Static output enables CDN distribution and geographic scaling
- **Vertical Scaling**: Single-threaded build process can utilize multiple CPU cores for file processing
- **Storage Scaling**: File system architecture supports unlimited content growth
- **Traffic Scaling**: Static site delivery handles unlimited concurrent readers

**Performance Monitoring:**
- **Build Time Tracking**: Monitoring build duration and identifying bottlenecks
- **API Response Times**: Dashboard endpoint performance measurement
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU utilization during build processes
- **File System Performance**: I/O operation timing and throughput measurement
```

### Context: reliability-availability (from 05_Operational_Architecture.md)

```markdown
**Reliability & Availability:**

**Fault Tolerance:**
- **Atomic Builds**: Complete success or complete rollback for site generation
- **Backup Strategy**: Automatic backup creation before each build operation
- **Rollback Capability**: Instant restoration to previous working state on build failure
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of file system and permission errors
- **Data Integrity**: Validation of content files and configuration during processing

**High Availability Design:**
```python
# Build safety implementation
def atomic_build():
    backup_current_build()  # Preserve working state
    try:
        generate_new_build()  # Create complete new build
        validate_build_output()  # Verify build integrity
        activate_new_build()  # Atomic swap to new version
    except Exception as e:
        restore_from_backup()  # Rollback on any failure
        raise BuildFailedException(f"Build failed: {e}")
    finally:
        cleanup_old_backups()  # Maintain backup retention
```

**Disaster Recovery:**
- **Content Backup**: File system backup strategy for content directory
- **Database Backup**: SQLite database backup and restoration procedures
- **Configuration Backup**: Version control for configuration files
- **Build Artifact Retention**: Multiple build versions for recovery scenarios

**System Recovery:**
- **Automatic Directory Creation**: Missing directory structure creation on startup
- **Permission Repair**: Automated fixing of common permission issues
- **Database Repair**: Automatic SQLite database creation and schema migration
- **Configuration Validation**: Startup validation with detailed error reporting
```

## 3. Codebase Analysis & Strategic Guidance

The following analysis is based on my direct review of the current codebase. Use these notes and tips to guide your implementation.

### Relevant Existing Code

*   **File:** `microblog/server/app.py`
    *   **Summary:** Contains the FastAPI application factory with middleware setup, route registration, and basic health check endpoint. Already has basic logging setup and a minimal health check.
    *   **Recommendation:** You MUST extend the existing health check endpoint at line 145-152 rather than creating a new one. You SHOULD enhance the existing logging setup at line 24 and use the existing logger instance.

*   **File:** `microblog/server/config.py`
    *   **Summary:** Comprehensive configuration management system with YAML parsing, validation, and hot-reload support. Uses Pydantic models for configuration validation.
    *   **Recommendation:** You SHOULD add logging configuration options to the existing Pydantic models (e.g., LoggingConfig class). You MUST use the existing ConfigManager pattern for any new configuration needs.

*   **File:** `microblog/server/middleware.py`
    *   **Summary:** Contains authentication, CSRF protection, and security headers middleware. Already has proper error handling patterns.
    *   **Recommendation:** You SHOULD follow the same middleware patterns and error handling approaches used in this file. The existing logger at line 19 should be used as a reference for logging patterns.

*   **File:** `microblog/server/build_service.py`
    *   **Summary:** Background build processing service with job queuing, progress tracking, and comprehensive status management. Already has excellent logging and monitoring patterns.
    *   **Recommendation:** You MUST use this file as a reference for monitoring patterns. The BuildService class shows excellent examples of structured logging, progress tracking, and error handling that you should emulate in your monitoring utilities.

### Implementation Tips & Notes

*   **Tip:** The project already uses the standard Python `logging` module extensively. You SHOULD build on this existing foundation rather than introducing new logging libraries.

*   **Note:** The existing health check at `app.py:145-152` is very basic and needs to be enhanced according to the architectural specification. You MUST implement database connection checks, filesystem permission checks, and last build status checks.

*   **Warning:** The application uses Pydantic extensively for configuration validation. Any new configuration options you add MUST follow the same patterns used in `config.py` with proper validation and type hints.

*   **Tip:** The BuildService in `build_service.py` already has excellent progress tracking and job monitoring. You SHOULD reuse these patterns for general system monitoring rather than duplicating the approach.

*   **Note:** The project follows a clean separation of concerns with utils, server, and service modules. Your new monitoring utilities MUST be placed in the `microblog/utils/` directory and health check enhancements in `microblog/server/`.

*   **Warning:** The middleware system is carefully layered (SecurityHeaders → CSRF → Authentication). Any new monitoring middleware MUST be added in the correct layer order and follow the same patterns.

*   **Tip:** The configuration system supports hot-reload in development mode. Any logging configuration changes SHOULD integrate with this existing hot-reload capability.
