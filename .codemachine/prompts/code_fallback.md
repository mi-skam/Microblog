# Code Refinement Task

The previous code submission did not pass verification. You must fix the following issues and resubmit your work.

---

## Original Task Description

Create comprehensive tests for build system including markdown processing, template rendering, asset management, and atomic build operations. Test build failure and rollback scenarios.

---

## Issues Detected

### Test API Mismatches
*   **API Mismatch:** Multiple tests fail because they use incorrect PostContent constructor arguments. The constructor expects `frontmatter`, `content`, `file_path`, `created_at`, `modified_at` but tests are passing `computed_slug` and `is_draft` which are properties.
*   **API Mismatch:** Tests expect "python" language identifier to appear in processed markdown HTML, but the syntax highlighter processes code blocks and doesn't preserve the language name in output.
*   **API Mismatch:** Some tests expect AssetManager to have `copy_all_assets` method but actual implementation has different method signatures.
*   **Missing Dependencies:** Some tests expect methods like `get_all_tags` and `render_tag_page` on TemplateRenderer that may not exist in current implementation.

### Test Coverage Gaps
*   **Missing Tests:** Need additional atomic operation failure tests for concurrent builds, corrupted template scenarios, and permission-based failures.
*   **Missing Tests:** Need performance tests that verify <5s build time for 100 posts requirement.
*   **Missing Tests:** Need memory usage tests during large builds.
*   **Missing Tests:** Need comprehensive rollback integrity verification tests.

## Best Approach to Fix

### Step 1: Fix PostContent Constructor Usage
You MUST update all PostContent instantiation in tests to use correct constructor signature:
```python
# Wrong (current tests):
post = PostContent(frontmatter=fm, content="...", computed_slug="...", is_draft=False)

# Correct:
post = PostContent(frontmatter=fm, content="...")
# Then access post.computed_slug and post.is_draft as properties
```

### Step 2: Fix Markdown Processing Expectations
Update markdown tests to check for actual generated HTML structure instead of expecting language identifiers:
```python
# Instead of checking for "python" in html, check for syntax highlighting classes
assert "highlight" in html or "codehilite" in html
```

### Step 3: Fix AssetManager and TemplateRenderer Method Calls
Review the actual implementation and update test expectations to match existing methods. Mock only methods that actually exist.

### Step 4: Add Missing Atomic Operation Tests
Add tests for:
- Concurrent build safety
- Backup integrity verification
- Build interruption scenarios
- Large file handling edge cases
- Template corruption detection
- Asset validation edge cases

### Step 5: Ensure >85% Test Coverage
Run coverage analysis and add tests for any uncovered code paths, particularly in error handling and edge cases.

Focus on fixing the API mismatches first to establish a working test baseline, then extend with additional failure scenarios and rollback testing as required by the acceptance criteria.
