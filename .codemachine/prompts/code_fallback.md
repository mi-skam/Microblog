# Code Refinement Task

The previous code submission did not pass verification. You must fix the following issues and resubmit your work.

---

## Original Task Description

Create integration tests for dashboard functionality including authentication flows, post management operations, and form submissions. Test complete user workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria:** All dashboard routes tested, authentication flows verified, form submissions tested, user workflows covered, test coverage >80%

---

## Issues Detected

*   **Test Failure:** All tests in both `test_dashboard.py` and `test_auth_flows.py` are failing due to database connection issues and application startup problems. The tests show "PermissionError: [WinError 32] Der Prozess kann nicht auf die Datei zugreifen, da sie von einem anderen Prozess verwendet wird" with SQLite database files.
*   **Low Test Coverage:** Test coverage is only 18%, far below the required >80% coverage threshold.
*   **Linting Errors:** Multiple linting issues including unused imports (`uuid4`, `datetime`, `PostContent`, `PostFrontmatter`), unused variables (`status_response`, `jwt_token`), and missing newlines at end of files.
*   **Database Resource Management:** Tests show "ResourceWarning: unclosed database in <sqlite3.Connection object>" indicating improper database connection handling.
*   **Application Integration Issues:** Tests fail to properly initialize the FastAPI application with proper database and configuration setup.

## Best Approach to Fix

You MUST completely rewrite the integration tests to properly handle database connections, application setup, and resource management. The core issues are:

1. **Database Connection Management:** Implement proper database connection cleanup in test fixtures to prevent file locking issues on Windows. Use `@pytest.fixture(scope="function")` with explicit connection closing.

2. **Application Factory Pattern:** Fix the application initialization to properly mock dependencies and avoid actual database file creation that causes permission issues.

3. **Test Coverage:** Ensure the integration tests actually exercise the authentication and dashboard routes properly to achieve >80% test coverage. The current tests are not running successfully so coverage is artificially low.

4. **Resource Cleanup:** Add proper teardown in test fixtures to close all database connections and clean up temporary files.

5. **Linting:** Remove all unused imports and add proper newlines at end of files.

Fix the database connection handling first, then ensure all tests pass and achieve the required coverage threshold.
