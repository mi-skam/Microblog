# Code Refinement Task

The previous code submission did not pass verification. You must fix the following issues and resubmit your work.

---

## Original Task Description

Create end-to-end tests for complete user workflows including authentication, post creation with images, live preview, publishing, and build processes.

**Target Files:**
- tests/e2e/test_complete_workflows.py
- tests/e2e/test_htmx_interactions.py

**Acceptance Criteria:** Complete user journeys tested, HTMX interactions verified, image upload workflows tested, build process integration tested, test coverage comprehensive

---

## Issues Detected

### **Test Failures in Complete Workflows:**
*   **Test Failure:** `test_post_editing_and_publishing_workflow` is failing because the edit endpoint `/dashboard/posts/draft-post/edit` returns 404 instead of 200.
*   **Test Failure:** `test_draft_to_published_state_workflow` is failing because the PUT endpoint `/api/posts/draft-article` returns 404 instead of 200.
*   **Test Failure:** `test_error_handling_in_complete_workflow` is failing because dashboard access returns 500 instead of expected error handling.
*   **Test Failure:** `test_multi_post_management_workflow` is failing because dashboard stats template expects different data format.
*   **Test Failure:** `test_form_validation_and_recovery_workflow` is failing because validation error messages don't match expected format.
*   **Test Failure:** `test_complete_workflow_with_tags` is failing because the API endpoint returns 404 instead of 201.

### **Test Failures in HTMX Interactions:**
*   **Test Failure:** `test_htmx_post_update_api` is failing because the PUT endpoint `/api/posts/htmx-test-post` returns 404 instead of 200.
*   **Test Failure:** `test_htmx_post_deletion_api` is failing because the DELETE endpoint `/api/posts/post-to-delete` returns 404 instead of 200.
*   **Test Failure:** `test_htmx_publish_unpublish_workflow` is failing because publish/unpublish endpoints return 404.
*   **Test Failure:** `test_htmx_markdown_preview_api` is failing because the preview endpoint returns 404.
*   **Test Failure:** Multiple image upload, build, and tag-related tests are failing because endpoints return 404.
*   **Test Failure:** `test_htmx_success_fragment_validation` is failing because the created post response doesn't match expected format.

### **Root Cause Analysis:**
*   **Missing Route Implementation:** Many API endpoints expected by the tests are not implemented or not properly routed in the application.
*   **Template Issues:** Dashboard templates are expecting different data structures than what the tests provide.
*   **Service Mocking Problems:** The test mocks are not properly interfacing with the actual service layer implementations.
*   **Authentication Issues:** Some endpoints may have authentication requirements that the test mocks don't properly satisfy.

## Best Approach to Fix

You MUST implement the missing API endpoints and fix the test expectations to match the actual application implementation. Follow this systematic approach:

1. **Review Actual API Routes:** First examine `microblog/server/routes/api.py` and `microblog/server/routes/dashboard.py` to understand which endpoints actually exist and their expected parameters.

2. **Fix Service Mocking:** Update the test mocks in both files to properly interface with the service layer. Ensure that `get_post_service()`, `get_image_service()`, `get_build_service()`, and `get_tag_service()` are mocked at the correct import paths.

3. **Implement Missing Endpoints:** If endpoints are missing from the actual API implementation, either:
   - Add placeholder endpoints that return appropriate responses for testing, OR
   - Update the tests to use endpoints that actually exist in the codebase

4. **Fix Template Data Expectations:** Update the test assertions to match the actual template data structures used by the dashboard. Check the template files in `content/templates/dashboard/` to understand the expected data format.

5. **Verify Authentication Flow:** Ensure that the authentication mocking in the test fixtures properly bypasses middleware and sets the required user state for protected endpoints.

6. **Update Error Handling Tests:** Review how the application actually handles errors and update the test expectations to match the real error response formats and status codes.

You MUST ensure that all test assertions match the actual API behavior, template structures, and error handling patterns implemented in the microblog application.
