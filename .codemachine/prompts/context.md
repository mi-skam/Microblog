## 2. Architectural & Planning Context

The following are the relevant sections from the architecture and plan documents, which I found by analyzing the task description.

### Context: authentication-authorization (from 05_Operational_Architecture.md)

```markdown
**Authentication & Authorization:**

**Authentication Strategy:**
- **Single-User Design**: System supports exactly one admin user with fixed role
- **JWT-Based Sessions**: Stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens
- **Secure Token Storage**: JWT stored in httpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookies
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with cost factor â‰¥12 for password storage
- **Session Management**: Configurable token expiration (default 2 hours)

**Implementation Details:**
```python
# Authentication flow
def authenticate_user(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[User]:
    user = get_user_by_username(username)
    if user and verify_password(password, user.password_hash):
        token = create_jwt_token(user.user_id, user.username)
        return user, token
    return None

# JWT Token Structure
{
    "user_id": 1,
    "username": "admin",
    "role": "admin",
    "exp": 1635724800,  # Expiration timestamp
    "iat": 1635721200   # Issued at timestamp
}
```

**Authorization Model:**
- **Role-Based**: Single admin role with full system access
- **Route Protection**: Middleware validates JWT for protected endpoints
- **CSRF Protection**: All state-changing operations require valid CSRF tokens
- **Session Validation**: Automatic token expiration and renewal handling
```

### Context: key-interaction-flow (from 04_Behavior_and_Communication.md)

```markdown
**Key Interaction Flow (Sequence Diagram):**

**Description:** This diagram illustrates the complete workflow for user authentication and post creation, showing the interaction between the web browser, dashboard application, authentication system, and content storage.

**Diagram (PlantUML):**
```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Content Author" as author
participant "Web Browser" as browser
participant "Dashboard App" as dashboard
participant "Auth Middleware" as auth
participant "Post Service" as posts
participant "Content Storage" as storage
participant "Static Generator" as generator
participant "Build Output" as build

== Authentication Flow ==
author -> browser : Enter credentials and login
browser -> dashboard : POST /auth/login (username, password)
dashboard -> auth : Validate credentials
auth -> dashboard : JWT token
dashboard -> browser : Set httpOnly cookie + redirect
browser -> author : Show dashboard interface

== Post Creation Flow ==
author -> browser : Click "New Post"
browser -> dashboard : GET /dashboard/posts/new
dashboard -> browser : HTML form with CSRF token
author -> browser : Fill form (title, content, tags)
browser -> dashboard : POST /api/posts (HTMX request)

dashboard -> auth : Validate JWT from cookie
auth -> dashboard : User authenticated

dashboard -> posts : Create post with metadata
posts -> storage : Write markdown file
storage -> posts : File created successfully
posts -> dashboard : Post created

dashboard -> generator : Trigger build process
generator -> storage : Read all content files
storage -> generator : Content data
generator -> build : Generate static HTML
build -> generator : Build completed
generator -> dashboard : Build status

dashboard -> browser : HTML fragment with success message
browser -> author : Show updated post list + success

== Live Preview Flow ==
author -> browser : Type in markdown editor
note right : 500ms debounce
browser -> dashboard : POST /api/preview (HTMX)
dashboard -> posts : Render markdown
posts -> dashboard : HTML preview
dashboard -> browser : HTML fragment
browser -> author : Live preview updated

```

### Context: security-considerations (from 05_Operational_Architecture.md)

```markdown
**Security Considerations:**

**Input Validation & Sanitization:**
- **Markdown Sanitization**: HTML escaping by default to prevent XSS attacks
- **File Upload Validation**: Extension whitelist, MIME type verification, size limits
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: Filename sanitization and directory boundary enforcement
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries for all database operations
- **Command Injection Prevention**: No direct shell execution from user input

**Security Headers:**
```python
# Security middleware configuration
SECURITY_HEADERS = {
    "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
    "X-Frame-Options": "DENY",
    "X-XSS-Protection": "1; mode=block",
    "Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains",
    "Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'"
}
```

**Data Protection:**
- **Secrets Management**: JWT secret stored in configuration with minimum 32-character requirement
- **Database Security**: SQLite file permissions restricted to application user
- **File System Security**: Content directory permissions preventing unauthorized access
- **Backup Security**: Build backups stored with same security constraints as primary data

**Vulnerability Mitigation:**
- **Rate Limiting**: Authentication endpoint protection against brute force attacks
- **CSRF Protection**: Synchronizer token pattern for all state-changing operations
- **Session Security**: Automatic token expiration and secure cookie attributes
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security updates for Python dependencies
```

### Context: authentication endpoints (from docs/api/openapi.yaml)

```markdown
  /auth/login:
    post:
      tags:
        - Authentication
      summary: User authentication

## 3. Codebase Analysis & Strategic Guidance

The following analysis is based on my direct review of the current codebase. Use these notes and tips to guide your implementation.

### Relevant Existing Code

*   **File:** `docs/api/openapi.yaml`
    *   **Summary:** Complete OpenAPI v3 specification already created (task I2.T1) that defines all authentication endpoints, security schemes, and data models including JWT cookie authentication and CSRF protection.
    *   **Recommendation:** You MUST use this OpenAPI specification as the authoritative source for authentication flow details. The endpoints /auth/login, /auth/logout, and /auth/check are fully documented with request/response formats.

*   **File:** `microblog/server/config.py`
    *   **Summary:** Comprehensive configuration management system with AuthConfig that includes JWT secret requirements (minimum 32 characters) and session expiration settings (default 2 hours).
    *   **Recommendation:** You SHOULD reference the AuthConfig model when showing JWT configuration in your diagram, particularly the session_expires setting.

*   **File:** `content/_data/config.yaml`
    *   **Summary:** Default configuration file showing jwt_secret and session_expires settings that will be used by the authentication system.
    *   **Recommendation:** You can reference these specific configuration values in your diagram to show realistic JWT expiration timeframes.

*   **File:** `microblog/cli.py`
    *   **Summary:** CLI includes a create_user command (currently TODO placeholder) that will handle initial user creation for the single-user system.
    *   **Recommendation:** Your authentication flow diagram should account for the fact that user creation happens via CLI, not through the web interface.

### Implementation Tips & Notes

*   **Tip:** The existing architectural documentation shows a detailed sequence diagram template in 04_Behavior_and_Communication.md that you SHOULD use as a structural reference for your authentication flow diagram.
*   **Note:** The system uses a single-user design pattern - your diagram should reflect that there's only one admin user with full system access, not a multi-user system.
*   **Security Focus:** The OpenAPI spec and architecture docs emphasize several security features that MUST be included in your diagram:
    - httpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookie attributes
    - CSRF token validation for state-changing operations
    - JWT token expiration and renewal handling
    - Rate limiting on authentication endpoints (future enhancement)
*   **Dependencies Available:** The pyproject.toml shows python-jose[cryptography] and passlib[bcrypt] are available for JWT handling and password hashing - these libraries should be referenced in any implementation details.
*   **Diagram Location:** Your target file `docs/diagrams/auth_flow.puml` should be placed alongside existing component_diagram.puml and database_erd.puml files.

### Critical Requirements from Task Description

*   **JWT Token Lifecycle:** Show complete flow from credential validation to token creation, storage in httpOnly cookie, and eventual expiration
*   **Cookie Handling:** Illustrate secure cookie attributes (httpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict) and cookie clearing on logout
*   **CSRF Protection:** Show how CSRF tokens are generated, included in forms, and validated on state-changing operations
*   **Dashboard Access Protection:** Demonstrate how middleware validates JWT tokens before allowing access to protected dashboard routes
*   **Session Management:** Include automatic token expiration handling and session validation for ongoing requests
