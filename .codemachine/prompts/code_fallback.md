# Code Refinement Task

The previous code submission did not pass verification. You must fix the following issues and resubmit your work.

---

## Original Task Description

Create integration tests for dashboard functionality including authentication flows, post management operations, and form submissions. Test complete user workflows.

---

## Issues Detected

*   **Test Coverage Below Requirement:** Current test coverage is only 12%, well below the required >80%. The tests are not using the real application architecture, which prevents proper coverage measurement.

*   **Missing Authentication Flow Tests:** The `test_auth_flows.py` file was deleted in the latest commit, but the task specifically requires "authentication flows" to be tested. This file must be recreated.

*   **Linting Errors:** There are 3 linting errors in `test_dashboard.py`: unused import (`os`), import sorting issues, and missing newline at end of file.

*   **Incomplete Application Integration:** The tests create a minimal FastAPI app instead of using `create_app()` from `microblog.server.app`. This bypasses the complete middleware stack (authentication, CSRF protection, security headers) and prevents proper integration testing.

*   **Insufficient Route Coverage:** While dashboard routes are tested, the authentication middleware integration is not properly tested, which is critical for achieving the required coverage.

## Best Approach to Fix

You MUST address all the identified issues to meet the acceptance criteria:

1. **Recreate Authentication Flow Tests:** Restore the `test_auth_flows.py` file that was deleted. This file must test login flows, logout flows, session management, and authentication middleware behavior.

2. **Use Real Application Architecture:** Modify `test_dashboard.py` to use `create_app(dev_mode=True)` from `microblog.server.app` instead of creating a minimal FastAPI app. This ensures all middleware layers are active and tested.

3. **Fix Linting Issues:** Run `ruff check --fix tests/integration/test_dashboard.py` to automatically fix the import sorting, unused imports, and missing newline issues.

4. **Improve Test Coverage:** Add tests that exercise the complete application stack including:
   - Authentication middleware behavior
   - CSRF protection validation
   - Error handling paths
   - Security headers and middleware integration
   - Complete request/response cycles through all middleware layers

5. **Enhance Integration Testing:** Ensure tests cover:
   - Unauthenticated access attempts to protected routes
   - Proper authentication state management
   - CSRF token validation on form submissions
   - Complete user workflows from login through post management

The goal is to achieve >80% test coverage by testing the complete application including all middleware components, not just the isolated route handlers.
