# Code Refinement Task

The previous code submission did not pass verification. You must fix the following issues and resubmit your work.

---

## Original Task Description

Create integration tests for dashboard functionality including authentication flows, post management operations, and form submissions. Test complete user workflows.

---

## Issues Detected

*   **Authentication Middleware Missing:** The integration tests are creating custom FastAPI applications without the proper `AuthenticationMiddleware`. This causes dashboard routes to fail with 500 errors instead of redirecting unauthenticated users to login as expected.

*   **Test Coverage Below Requirement:** Current test coverage is only 13-22%, well below the required >80%. The tests are not running correctly due to middleware issues, preventing proper coverage measurement.

*   **Improper Test Application Setup:** Both `test_dashboard.py` and `test_auth_flows.py` create custom FastAPI apps instead of using the `create_app()` function from `microblog.server.app` which includes all necessary middleware (AuthenticationMiddleware, CSRFProtectionMiddleware, SecurityHeadersMiddleware).

*   **Template Response API Usage:** Tests show deprecation warnings for `TemplateResponse` API usage - the first parameter should be the `Request` instance, not the template name.

## Best Approach to Fix

You MUST modify the test fixtures to use the proper `create_app()` function instead of creating custom FastAPI applications. The current approach bypasses all the essential middleware that makes the application work correctly.

1. **Update test fixtures:** Replace the custom FastAPI app creation in test fixtures with `create_app(dev_mode=True)` from `microblog.server.app`

2. **Mock authentication properly:** Instead of bypassing authentication middleware, mock the JWT verification and user retrieval functions at the appropriate level

3. **Fix template configuration:** Ensure the test environment properly sets up the template directory so the app can find the templates

4. **Use proper mocking strategy:** Mock the authentication components (`verify_jwt_token`, `get_current_user`) instead of creating custom middleware

The authentication middleware expects:
- `/dashboard` paths to be protected
- Unauthenticated users redirected to `/auth/login`
- JWT tokens to be validated from cookies
- Request state to be properly set

After fixing the middleware setup, re-run the tests to verify they pass and achieve the required >80% test coverage.
