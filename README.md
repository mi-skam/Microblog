### Project Status

This is an early development version (v0.1.0). The basic project structure and CLI framework are implemented, but core functionality is still being developed.

**Current Status**:
- âœ… Project structure and packaging
- âœ… CLI framework with Click
- âœ… Docker configuration
- âœ… Development tooling setup
- ðŸš§ Static site generation (next iteration)
- ðŸš§ Dashboard web application (next iteration)
- ðŸš§ Authentication system (next iteration)
- ðŸš§ Content management (next iteration)

## Architecture

Microblog uses a hybrid static-first architecture:

1. **Static Site Generation**: Content is processed into static HTML for optimal performance
2. **Dynamic Dashboard**: HTMX-powered interface for content management
3. **Single-User Design**: Simplified authentication and user management
4. **Full Rebuild Strategy**: Complete site regeneration for consistency

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through YAML files in the `content/_data/` directory:

- `config.yaml` - Main site configuration
- Environment variables for deployment settings
- CLI options for development overrides
