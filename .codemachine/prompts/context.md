## 2. Architectural & Planning Context

The following are the relevant sections from the architecture and plan documents, which I found by analyzing the task description.

### Context: authentication-authorization (from 05_Operational_Architecture.md)

```markdown
**Authentication & Authorization:**

**Authentication Strategy:**
- **Single-User Design**: System supports exactly one admin user with fixed role
- **JWT-Based Sessions**: Stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens
- **Secure Token Storage**: JWT stored in httpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookies
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with cost factor â‰¥12 for password storage
- **Session Management**: Configurable token expiration (default 2 hours)

**Implementation Details:**
```python
# Authentication flow
def authenticate_user(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[User]:
    user = get_user_by_username(username)
    if user and verify_password(password, user.password_hash):
        token = create_jwt_token(user.user_id, user.username)
        return user, token
    return None

# JWT Token Structure
{
    "user_id": 1,
    "username": "admin",
    "role": "admin",
    "exp": 1635724800,  # Expiration timestamp
    "iat": 1635721200   # Issued at timestamp
}
```

**Authorization Model:**
- **Role-Based**: Single admin role with full system access
- **Route Protection**: Middleware validates JWT for protected endpoints
- **CSRF Protection**: All state-changing operations require valid CSRF tokens
- **Session Validation**: Automatic token expiration and renewal handling
```

### Context: api-design-communication (from 04_Behavior_and_Communication.md)

```markdown
**API Design & Communication**

**API Style:** RESTful HTTP API with HTMX Enhancement

The MicroBlog system employs a RESTful API design enhanced with HTMX for dynamic interactions. This approach provides a traditional web application experience while enabling progressive enhancement through AJAX-style interactions without complex JavaScript frameworks.

**API Design Principles:**
- **REST-compliant**: Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with semantic URLs
- **HTML-first**: Primary responses are HTML fragments for HTMX consumption
- **Progressive Enhancement**: All functionality works with and without JavaScript
- **Stateless**: JWT-based authentication eliminates server-side session management
- **CSRF Protection**: All state-changing operations include CSRF token validation

**API Categories:**

1. **Authentication Endpoints**
   - `POST /auth/login` - User authentication with credential validation
   - `POST /auth/logout` - Session termination and cookie clearing
   - `GET /auth/check` - Session validation for protected routes

2. **Dashboard Page Routes**
   - `GET /dashboard` - Main dashboard with post listing
   - `GET /dashboard/posts/new` - New post creation form
   - `GET /dashboard/posts/{id}/edit` - Post editing interface
   - `GET /dashboard/settings` - Configuration management interface

3. **HTMX API Endpoints**
   - `POST /api/posts` - Create new post with live feedback
   - `PUT /api/posts/{id}` - Update existing post content
   - `DELETE /api/posts/{id}` - Delete post with confirmation
   - `POST /api/posts/{id}/publish` - Toggle post publication status
   - `POST /api/build` - Trigger site rebuild with progress updates
   - `POST /api/images` - Handle image uploads with validation
```

### Context: key-interaction-flow (from 04_Behavior_and_Communication.md)

```markdown
**Key Interaction Flow (Sequence Diagram):**

**Description:** This diagram illustrates the complete workflow for user authentication and post creation, showing the interaction between the web browser, dashboard application, authentication system, and content storage.

**Diagram (PlantUML):**
```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Content Author" as author
participant "Web Browser" as browser
participant "Dashboard App" as dashboard
participant "Auth Middleware" as auth
participant "Post Service" as posts
participant "Content Storage" as storage
participant "Static Generator" as generator
participant "Build Output" as build

== Authentication Flow ==
author -> browser : Enter credentials and login
browser -> dashboard : POST /auth/login (username, password)
dashboard -> auth : Validate credentials
auth -> dashboard : JWT token
dashboard -> browser : Set httpOnly cookie + redirect
browser -> author : Show dashboard interface

== Post Creation Flow ==
author -> browser : Click "New Post"
browser -> dashboard : GET /dashboard/posts/new
dashboard -> browser : HTML form with CSRF token
author -> browser : Fill form (title, content, tags)
browser -> dashboard : POST /api/posts (HTMX request)

dashboard -> auth : Validate JWT from cookie
auth -> dashboard : User authenticated

dashboard -> posts : Create post with metadata
posts -> storage : Write markdown file
storage -> posts : File created successfully
posts -> dashboard : Post created

dashboard -> generator : Trigger build process
generator -> storage : Read all content files
storage -> generator : Content data
generator -> build : Generate static HTML
build -> generator : Build completed
generator -> dashboard : Build status

dashboard -> browser : HTML fragment with success message
browser -> author : Show updated post list + success

== Live Preview Flow ==
author -> browser : Type in markdown editor
note right : 500ms debounce
browser -> dashboard : POST /api/preview (HTMX)
dashboard -> posts : Render markdown
posts -> dashboard : HTML preview
dashboard -> browser : HTML fragment
browser -> author : Live preview updated

## 3. Codebase Analysis & Strategic Guidance

The following analysis is based on my direct review of the current codebase. Use these notes and tips to guide your implementation.

### Relevant Existing Code

*   **File:** `microblog/server/app.py`
    *   **Summary:** FastAPI application factory with complete middleware stack including authentication, CSRF protection, and security headers. Contains development and production configurations.
    *   **Recommendation:** You MUST test the application created by the `create_app()` factory function. The app has middleware layers that need to be properly mocked for testing authentication flows.

*   **File:** `microblog/server/routes/dashboard.py`
    *   **Summary:** Complete dashboard routes including main dashboard, posts listing, post creation/editing, and settings. Contains both page routes and API endpoints for post management.
    *   **Recommendation:** You MUST test all the dashboard routes: `/dashboard/`, `/dashboard/posts`, `/dashboard/posts/new`, `/dashboard/posts/{slug}/edit`, `/dashboard/settings`, and the API endpoints `/dashboard/api/posts` and `/dashboard/api/posts/{slug}`.

*   **File:** `tests/conftest.py`
    *   **Summary:** Contains shared test fixtures including temporary config files, valid/invalid config data, mock callbacks, and content directory setup.
    *   **Recommendation:** You SHOULD reuse the existing fixtures like `valid_config_data`, `temp_config_file`, and `temp_content_dir` for consistent test setup.

*   **File:** `tests/integration/test_dashboard.py`
    *   **Summary:** Existing comprehensive integration tests for dashboard functionality with sophisticated mocking patterns and complete test coverage.
    *   **Recommendation:** This file already EXISTS and is comprehensive. You SHOULD examine it carefully before deciding what additional tests might be needed for the acceptance criteria.

*   **File:** `tests/integration/test_auth_flows.py`
    *   **Summary:** Existing integration tests for authentication flows including login, logout, session validation, and CSRF protection.
    *   **Recommendation:** This file already EXISTS with comprehensive auth testing. You SHOULD review it to understand the mocking patterns and ensure all acceptance criteria are met.

### Implementation Tips & Notes

*   **Tip:** The existing test files in `tests/integration/` already provide extensive coverage of dashboard functionality and authentication flows. Both target files for this task already exist with sophisticated test implementations.

*   **Note:** The existing tests use a pattern of creating minimal FastAPI apps with proper template setup and extensive mocking of dependencies like `get_post_service()`, `get_current_user()`, and `get_csrf_token()`.

*   **Warning:** The acceptance criteria requires >80% test coverage. The existing test files already contain comprehensive test scenarios. You should analyze them to determine if they meet the acceptance criteria or if additional tests are needed.

*   **Critical Finding:** Both target files `tests/integration/test_dashboard.py` and `tests/integration/test_auth_flows.py` already exist with extensive test coverage including:
    - Dashboard routes testing (home, posts list, new post, edit post, settings)
    - Authentication flow testing (login, logout, session validation)
    - Form submission testing (post creation/update via API)
    - Complete user workflow testing (creation to editing workflows)
    - Error scenario testing (validation errors, file errors, authentication errors)
    - CSRF protection testing
    - Template rendering integration testing

*   **Strategic Guidance:** Since both target files already exist with comprehensive coverage, you should:
    1. **First:** Analyze the existing tests to verify they meet all acceptance criteria
    2. **Then:** Run the tests to check current coverage levels
    3. **Finally:** Only add additional tests if gaps are found in coverage or acceptance criteria

*   **Coverage Note:** The existing tests use sophisticated mocking patterns to avoid dependencies on file system, database, and configuration files, making them reliable for CI/CD environments.
