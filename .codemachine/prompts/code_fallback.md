# Code Refinement Task

The previous code submission did not pass verification. You must fix the following issues and resubmit your work.

---

## Original Task Description

Create comprehensive tests for build system including markdown processing, template rendering, asset management, and atomic build operations. Test build failure and rollback scenarios.

**Agent Type Hint:** TestingAgent
**Input Files:** ["microblog/builder/generator.py", "microblog/builder/markdown_processor.py", "microblog/builder/template_renderer.py", "tests/conftest.py"]
**Target Files:** ["tests/unit/test_build_system.py", "tests/integration/test_build_process.py"]
**Deliverables:** Comprehensive build system test suite with failure scenario testing
**Acceptance Criteria:** All build components tested, atomic operations verified, rollback scenarios tested, test coverage >85%, performance tests included

---

## Issues Detected

*   **Test Failure:** The test case `test_build_site_convenience_function` is failing with error "not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 0)" during build preconditions validation. This indicates that `template_renderer.validate_template()` is not returning the expected tuple format.

*   **Insufficient Test Coverage:** Several build system components have test coverage below the required 85%:
    - `asset_manager.py`: 71% coverage (need 85%+)
    - `markdown_processor.py`: 72% coverage (need 85%+)
    - `template_renderer.py`: 82% coverage (need 85%+)

*   **Test Robustness Issues:** Multiple tests had to be made more lenient with "or" conditions in assertion statements, indicating that the underlying implementation may not be consistent or reliable:
    - Rollback success/failure messaging inconsistencies
    - Asset copying validation relaxed
    - Template validation made optional
    - Build failure scenarios with multiple acceptable outcomes

*   **Implementation Bug:** The `validate_template` method in template_renderer.py is not properly returning a tuple of (bool, str|None) as expected by the generator's validation logic.

## Best Approach to Fix

You MUST address these issues systematically:

1. **Fix the validate_template implementation bug:** Ensure that `template_renderer.validate_template()` consistently returns a tuple of (bool, str|None) in all code paths. Check for any edge cases where the method might return None or a different format.

2. **Increase test coverage for build components:** Add targeted tests to bring coverage above 85% for:
   - Asset manager error handling, security validation, and edge cases
   - Markdown processor content validation, frontmatter parsing errors, and malformed input handling
   - Template renderer custom filters, error conditions, and template validation edge cases

3. **Strengthen test assertions:** Replace lenient "or" conditions with specific, deterministic test expectations. The tests should validate exact behavior rather than accepting multiple possible outcomes.

4. **Add missing edge case tests:** Focus on error scenarios, boundary conditions, and failure modes that are currently not covered, particularly:
   - Template validation with empty/missing template directories
   - Asset manager with permission issues and corrupted files
   - Markdown processor with malformed YAML frontmatter and encoding issues
   - Build generator atomic operations with disk space limitations

5. **Ensure atomic operation integrity:** Verify that all backup/rollback scenarios work correctly and that the build system maintains consistency even during failures.

The goal is to have a robust test suite with >85% coverage that validates the build system's reliability under all conditions, not just happy path scenarios.
