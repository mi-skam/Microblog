# Code Refinement Task

The previous code submission did not pass verification. You must fix the following issues and resubmit your work.

---

## Original Task Description

Create integration tests for dashboard functionality including authentication flows, post management operations, and form submissions. Test complete user workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria:** All dashboard routes tested, authentication flows verified, form submissions tested, user workflows covered, test coverage >80%

---

## Issues Detected

*   **Test Failure:** `test_unauthenticated_access_protection` in `test_dashboard.py` is failing because the unauthenticated client gets 500 errors instead of expected 302/401/404 status codes when accessing protected routes.
*   **Test Failure:** `test_post_service_error_handling_integration` in `test_dashboard.py` is failing with assertion errors in the status code checks.
*   **Test Failure:** `test_successful_login_flow` in `test_auth_flows.py` is failing because JWT cookies are not being set properly in the response.
*   **Test Failure:** `test_auth_route_coverage` in `test_auth_flows.py` is failing because logout routes return unexpected status codes.
*   **Coverage Issue:** Overall test coverage is only 24%, far below the required >80% threshold. Critical modules like authentication, content management, and dashboard routes need better coverage.
*   **Linting Error:** Import block is unsorted in `tests/integration/test_auth_flows.py` line 8.
*   **Linting Error:** Missing newline at end of file in `tests/integration/test_auth_flows.py` line 310.

## Best Approach to Fix

You MUST fix the failing integration tests by improving the mocking strategy and error handling:

1. **Fix Authentication Test Failures:** Update the JWT cookie setting mechanism in `test_successful_login_flow` by properly configuring the FastAPI TestClient response and cookie handling.

2. **Fix Dashboard Protection Tests:** Improve the mocking of authentication middleware in `test_unauthenticated_access_protection` to ensure unauthenticated requests get proper 302/401 redirects instead of 500 errors.

3. **Fix Error Handling Tests:** Update the error scenario tests to handle the actual exception flow and status codes returned by the FastAPI application.

4. **Improve Test Coverage:** Add comprehensive tests for uncovered modules including:
   - Authentication middleware integration tests
   - Post service CRUD operations
   - Content validation and error handling
   - JWT token creation and verification
   - Password hashing and verification
   - Configuration management
   - Template rendering integration

5. **Fix Linting Issues:** Sort the imports in `test_auth_flows.py` and add the missing newline at the end of the file.

6. **Enhance Mocking Strategy:** Use more realistic mocking that properly simulates the actual application behavior, especially for authentication flows and middleware integration.

Focus on creating tests that achieve >80% coverage while ensuring all tests pass reliably. The tests should properly exercise the authentication flows, dashboard functionality, and complete user workflows as specified in the acceptance criteria.
