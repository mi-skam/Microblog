# Code Refinement Task

The previous code submission did not pass verification. You must fix the following issues and resubmit your work.

---

## Original Task Description

Create comprehensive tests for build system including markdown processing, template rendering, asset management, and atomic build operations. Test build failure and rollback scenarios.

**Acceptance Criteria:** All build components tested, atomic operations verified, rollback scenarios tested, test coverage >85%, performance tests included

---

## Issues Detected

*   **Test Failure:** Multiple tests are failing due to incorrect PostContent initialization. The tests use `computed_slug` parameter which doesn't exist in the actual PostContent class.
*   **Import Errors:** Many BuildGenerator tests fail with import/module errors, suggesting missing or incorrect dependencies.
*   **Linting Errors:** Tests had multiple linting issues including unused imports and formatting problems (already fixed).
*   **Incomplete Mocking:** Several tests use incomplete mocks that don't properly simulate the actual dependencies and their interfaces.
*   **API Mismatch:** Integration tests assume APIs that don't match the actual implementation (e.g., PostContent constructor signature).
*   **Performance Test Issues:** Performance tests fail due to missing psutil dependency and incorrect mocking setup.
*   **Build Generator Errors:** All BuildGenerator tests produce errors, indicating fundamental issues with test setup and dependency mocking.

## Best Approach to Fix

You MUST fix the following specific issues:

1. **Fix PostContent Usage**: Examine the actual PostContent class in `microblog/content/validators.py` and update all test code to use the correct constructor parameters. Remove any references to `computed_slug` if it doesn't exist.

2. **Fix BuildGenerator Test Setup**: Examine the actual BuildGenerator class in `microblog/builder/generator.py` and ensure all mocks properly simulate the expected dependencies and their method signatures.

3. **Add Missing Dependencies**: If psutil is required for performance tests, either add it to the project dependencies or mock the memory usage functionality appropriately.

4. **Verify Import Paths**: Ensure all imports in the test files match the actual module structure and class names in the codebase.

5. **Complete Mock Setup**: For each test class, ensure mocks properly implement all methods that are called during testing, including return values that match expected types.

6. **Test Data Structure**: Create realistic test data that matches the actual data structures used by the build system components.

The tests should comprehensively cover all BuildPhase enumerations, BuildResult success/failure scenarios, rollback mechanisms, and performance requirements as specified in the acceptance criteria.
