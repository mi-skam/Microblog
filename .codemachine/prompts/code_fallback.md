# Code Refinement Task

The previous code submission did not pass verification. You must fix the following issues and resubmit your work.

---

## Original Task Description

Initialize project structure, Python package setup, and basic CLI framework with Click. Create all necessary directories and files, set up pyproject.toml with dependencies, and implement basic CLI commands for build and serve operations.

---

## Issues Detected

*   **Linting Errors:** Multiple linting errors found in the codebase including:
    - Missing newlines at end of files in multiple modules
    - Unused imports (`typing.Optional`, `uvicorn`, `os`) in `microblog/cli.py` and `microblog/utils.py`
    - Unsorted imports in `microblog/cli.py`
    - Deprecated ruff configuration in `pyproject.toml` (top-level settings should be moved to `lint` section)

*   **CLI Installation Issue:** The `microblog` command is not available in the PATH after installation, requiring users to use `python -m microblog.cli` instead

---

## Best Approach to Fix

You MUST:

1. **Fix ruff configuration in pyproject.toml**: Move the deprecated top-level ruff settings (`select`, `ignore`, `per-file-ignores`) into a `[tool.ruff.lint]` section to resolve the deprecation warnings.

2. **Fix all linting errors automatically**: Run `python -m ruff check --fix microblog/` to automatically fix all the formatting and import issues.

3. **Remove unused imports**: Manually review and remove any remaining unused imports that ruff couldn't auto-fix.

4. **Verify CLI functionality**: Ensure that after fixing the issues, `python -m microblog.cli --help` still works correctly and displays the proper command structure.

All fixes should maintain the existing functionality while ensuring the code passes linting checks.
