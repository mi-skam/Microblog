# Code Refinement Task

The previous code submission did not pass verification. You must fix the following issues and resubmit your work.

---

## Original Task Description

Create comprehensive tests for build system including markdown processing, template rendering, asset management, and atomic build operations. Test build failure and rollback scenarios.

**Agent Type Hint:** TestingAgent
**Inputs:** Build system implementation, testing requirements, failure scenario testing
**Input Files:** ["microblog/builder/generator.py", "microblog/builder/markdown_processor.py", "microblog/builder/template_renderer.py", "tests/conftest.py"]
**Target Files:** ["tests/unit/test_build_system.py", "tests/integration/test_build_process.py"]
**Deliverables:** Comprehensive build system test suite with failure scenario testing
**Acceptance Criteria:** All build components tested, atomic operations verified, rollback scenarios tested, test coverage >85%, performance tests included

---

## Issues Detected

* **Test Failure:** `TestAssetManager::test_copy_directory_assets` - Assertion failure with expected 2 total_failed but got 0
* **Test Failure:** `TestBuildGenerator::test_build_failure_with_rollback` - Expected 'rollback successful' in error message but got "Build failed and rollback failed: Template rendering failed: 'Mock' object is not iterable"
* **Test Failure:** `TestBuildFailureScenarios::test_build_with_insufficient_permissions` - Expected 'preconditions validation failed' but got 'build failed but rollback successful: failed to create backup'
* **Test Failure:** `TestPerformanceBuildTests::test_build_time_small_content` and `test_build_time_medium_content` - Performance tests failing due to assertion errors
* **Test Failure:** `TestAtomicOperationFailures::test_build_interruption_scenarios` - Expected 'Build interrupted' in error message but got 'Content processing failed: Failed to process 1 posts'
* **Integration Test Failures:** Multiple integration tests failing due to missing assets and incorrect mock setup
* **Mock Object Issues:** Several tests have incorrect mock configurations causing "'Mock' object is not iterable" and similar errors
* **PostContent Constructor Issues:** Tests using invalid PostContent constructor parameters (computed_slug, is_draft don't exist)

## Best Approach to Fix

You MUST fix the failing tests by addressing the following specific issues:

1. **Fix PostContent Constructor Usage:** Remove invalid parameters `computed_slug` and `is_draft` from PostContent instantiations throughout the test files. PostContent only accepts `frontmatter` and `content` parameters.

2. **Fix Mock Object Configuration:** Ensure all mock objects used in tests properly implement the expected interfaces:
   - Mock iterables should return actual iterables, not Mock objects
   - Template renderer mocks should properly handle template validation and rendering
   - Asset manager mocks should return proper data structures

3. **Fix Error Message Assertions:** Update assertion checks to match the actual error messages returned by the build system:
   - Check for specific error patterns rather than exact string matches
   - Verify that error messages contain relevant information about the failure cause

4. **Fix Performance Test Logic:** Review and correct the performance test implementations to properly measure build times and assert reasonable performance benchmarks.

5. **Fix Integration Test Asset Handling:** Ensure integration tests properly set up and verify asset copying functionality, including creating the necessary directory structures and files.

6. **Fix Atomic Operation Test Scenarios:** Correct the build interruption test to properly simulate and verify build interruption scenarios and rollback mechanisms.

Focus on making tests pass while maintaining their intended functionality and coverage goals. All tests must pass without compromising the quality and comprehensiveness of the test suite.
