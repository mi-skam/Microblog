# Code Refinement Task

The previous code submission did not pass verification. You must fix the following issues and resubmit your work.

---

## Original Task Description

Create integration tests for dashboard functionality including authentication flows, post management operations, and form submissions. Test complete user workflows.

---

## Issues Detected

*   **Template Resolution Issue:** The integration tests are failing because the dashboard routes are hardcoded to load templates from the project root `templates` directory, but the test fixtures are creating temporary templates in a different location. This causes "template not found" errors during test execution.

*   **Template Mocking Problem:** The test fixtures in both `test_dashboard.py` and `test_auth_flows.py` create temporary templates in the content directory structure, but the `Jinja2Templates` initialization in `microblog/server/routes/dashboard.py` uses a hardcoded path that doesn't get mocked properly.

*   **Integration Test Coverage:** While the tests are comprehensive in structure, they fail to execute successfully due to the template loading issue, preventing proper validation of the dashboard and authentication workflows.

## Best Approach to Fix

You MUST modify the template initialization in the dashboard routes to be mockable during testing. The current hardcoded approach in `microblog/server/routes/dashboard.py` line 31 needs to be replaced with a configuration-based or injectable approach that can be properly mocked in tests.

Options to fix this:

1. **Modify dashboard.py**: Replace the hardcoded template directory with a configurable path that can be overridden during testing
2. **Update test fixtures**: Mock the `templates` object directly in the dashboard routes module instead of trying to mock the template directory path
3. **Create template factory**: Use a template factory function that can be easily mocked during testing

The same issue likely exists in other route modules that use templates, so ensure a consistent approach across all route modules.

After fixing the template loading issue, re-run the integration tests to verify they pass and achieve the required >80% test coverage.
