## 2. Architectural & Planning Context

The following are the relevant sections from the architecture and plan documents, which I found by analyzing the task description.

### Context: authentication-authorization (from 05_Operational_Architecture.md)

```markdown
**Authentication & Authorization:**

**Authentication Strategy:**
- **Single-User Design**: System supports exactly one admin user with fixed role
- **JWT-Based Sessions**: Stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens
- **Secure Token Storage**: JWT stored in httpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookies
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with cost factor â‰¥12 for password storage
- **Session Management**: Configurable token expiration (default 2 hours)

**Implementation Details:**
```python
# Authentication flow
def authenticate_user(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[User]:
    user = get_user_by_username(username)
    if user and verify_password(password, user.password_hash):
        token = create_jwt_token(user.user_id, user.username)
        return user, token
    return None

# JWT Token Structure
{
    "user_id": 1,
    "username": "admin",
    "role": "admin",
    "exp": 1635724800,  # Expiration timestamp
    "iat": 1635721200   # Issued at timestamp
}
```

**Authorization Model:**
- **Role-Based**: Single admin role with full system access
- **Route Protection**: Middleware validates JWT for protected endpoints
- **CSRF Protection**: All state-changing operations require valid CSRF tokens
- **Session Validation**: Automatic token expiration and renewal handling
```

### Context: key-interaction-flow (from 04_Behavior_and_Communication.md)

```markdown
**Key Interaction Flow (Sequence Diagram):**

**Description:** This diagram illustrates the complete workflow for user authentication and post creation, showing the interaction between the web browser, dashboard application, authentication system, and content storage.

**Diagram (PlantUML):**
```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Content Author" as author
participant "Web Browser" as browser
participant "Dashboard App" as dashboard
participant "Auth Middleware" as auth
participant "Post Service" as posts
participant "Content Storage" as storage
participant "Static Generator" as generator
participant "Build Output" as build

== Authentication Flow ==
author -> browser : Enter credentials and login
browser -> dashboard : POST /auth/login (username, password)
dashboard -> auth : Validate credentials
auth -> dashboard : JWT token
dashboard -> browser : Set httpOnly cookie + redirect
browser -> author : Show dashboard interface

== Post Creation Flow ==
author -> browser : Click "New Post"
browser -> dashboard : GET /dashboard/posts/new
dashboard -> browser : HTML form with CSRF token
author -> browser : Fill form (title, content, tags)
browser -> dashboard : POST /api/posts (HTMX request)

dashboard -> auth : Validate JWT from cookie
auth -> dashboard : User authenticated

dashboard -> posts : Create post with metadata
posts -> storage : Write markdown file
storage -> posts : File created successfully
posts -> dashboard : Post created

dashboard -> generator : Trigger build process
generator -> storage : Read all content files
storage -> generator : Content data
generator -> build : Generate static HTML
build -> generator : Build completed
generator -> dashboard : Build status

dashboard -> browser : HTML fragment with success message
browser -> author : Show updated post list + success

== Live Preview Flow ==
author -> browser : Type in markdown editor
note right : 500ms debounce
browser -> dashboard : POST /api/preview (HTMX)
dashboard -> posts : Render markdown
posts -> dashboard : HTML preview
dashboard -> browser : HTML fragment
browser -> author : Live preview updated

## 3. Codebase Analysis & Strategic Guidance

The following analysis is based on my direct review of the current codebase. Use these notes and tips to guide your implementation.

### Relevant Existing Code

*   **File:** `tests/conftest.py`
    *   **Summary:** This file provides shared test fixtures including configuration data, temporary directories, and mock callbacks for testing.
    *   **Recommendation:** You MUST import and use the existing fixtures like `valid_config_data`, `temp_config_file`, and `mock_config_callback` from this file for consistent test setup.

*   **File:** `microblog/server/app.py`
    *   **Summary:** This file contains the FastAPI application factory with middleware configuration, route registration, and security setup.
    *   **Recommendation:** You MUST use the `create_app()` function from this file to create test application instances. The app includes security middleware, CSRF protection, and authentication middleware that need to be tested.

*   **File:** `microblog/server/routes/dashboard.py`
    *   **Summary:** This file contains all dashboard routes including GET routes for pages and POST routes for API operations. Contains comprehensive error handling and validation.
    *   **Recommendation:** You MUST test all routes in this file including `/dashboard/`, `/dashboard/posts`, `/dashboard/posts/new`, `/dashboard/posts/{slug}/edit`, `/dashboard/settings`, `/dashboard/pages`, and the API endpoints `/dashboard/api/posts` and `/dashboard/api/posts/{slug}`.

*   **File:** `microblog/server/routes/auth.py`
    *   **Summary:** This file contains authentication routes for login, logout, and session management with comprehensive security features including CSRF protection.
    *   **Recommendation:** You MUST test the authentication endpoints `/auth/login`, `/auth/logout`, `/auth/check`, and `/auth/status` from this file. Pay special attention to CSRF token handling and cookie security.

*   **File:** `tests/integration/test_dashboard.py`
    *   **Summary:** This file already contains a comprehensive integration test suite for dashboard functionality with detailed mocking strategies.
    *   **Recommendation:** You SHOULD study the existing test patterns in this file. The TestDashboardIntegrationFixed class provides excellent examples of how to mock authentication, post services, and templates. The file already covers most dashboard functionality.

### Implementation Tips & Notes

*   **Tip:** I have confirmed that there is an existing comprehensive test file at `tests/integration/test_dashboard.py` that already implements most of the required functionality. You SHOULD review this file carefully and build upon it rather than starting from scratch.

*   **Note:** The existing dashboard tests use a sophisticated mocking strategy with `patch()` decorators to mock authentication middleware, post services, and template rendering. You SHOULD follow the same patterns for consistency.

*   **Warning:** The authentication system requires careful handling of JWT cookies, CSRF tokens, and middleware integration. The existing tests show how to properly mock `get_current_user()` and `get_csrf_token()` functions that are critical for testing authenticated routes.

*   **Tip:** The target task requires creating `tests/integration/test_auth_flows.py` which does not exist yet. You SHOULD focus on creating this file to test the authentication workflows, as the dashboard tests are already well-covered.

*   **Note:** The acceptance criteria requires >80% test coverage. The existing dashboard tests appear comprehensive but you should verify coverage and potentially extend tests to meet this requirement.

*   **Warning:** The task involves testing form submissions which require proper CSRF token handling. The existing code shows examples of how to include `csrf_token` in form data for POST requests.

*   **Tip:** The codebase uses FastAPI TestClient for integration testing. You SHOULD use the same approach and leverage the existing `authenticated_client` fixture pattern shown in the current test file.

*   **Note:** The existing test file includes comprehensive error handling scenarios, validation error testing, and complete workflow simulations. These patterns SHOULD be extended to the authentication flow testing as well.

## 3. Codebase Analysis & Strategic Guidance

The following analysis is based on my direct review of the current codebase. Use these notes and tips to guide your implementation.

### Relevant Existing Code

*   **File:** `tests/integration/test_auth_flows.py`
    *   **Summary:** Comprehensive authentication integration tests with mocking patterns, temporary directory setup, and client fixtures for authenticated/unauthenticated states.
    *   **Recommendation:** You SHOULD use the existing patterns from this file as a template. The test structure includes proper fixtures for temporary project directories, template creation, and client setup with authentication mocking.

*   **File:** `tests/integration/test_dashboard.py`
    *   **Summary:** Existing dashboard integration tests that cover basic functionality like home page, posts list, form displays, and API endpoints with proper mocking.
    *   **Recommendation:** This file already exists and needs to be enhanced to meet the acceptance criteria. You SHOULD extend it rather than replacing it completely.

*   **File:** `tests/conftest.py`
    *   **Summary:** Shared test fixtures including temporary config files, valid/invalid config data, and mock callbacks for configuration testing.
    *   **Recommendation:** You SHOULD leverage the existing fixtures and add any new fixtures needed for dashboard testing.

*   **File:** `microblog/server/app.py`
    *   **Summary:** FastAPI application factory with complete middleware stack (security headers, CSRF, authentication), route registration, and proper startup/shutdown handlers.
    *   **Recommendation:** You MUST use the `create_app()` function in your tests to get the complete application with all middleware layers active.

*   **File:** `microblog/server/routes/dashboard.py`
    *   **Summary:** Complete dashboard routes including GET routes for dashboard pages and POST API endpoints for post CRUD operations. Uses proper authentication and CSRF protection.
    *   **Recommendation:** Your tests MUST cover all routes in this file: `/dashboard/`, `/dashboard/posts`, `/dashboard/posts/new`, `/dashboard/posts/{slug}/edit`, `/dashboard/settings`, `/dashboard/pages`, and the API endpoints.

### Implementation Tips & Notes

*   **Tip:** The existing tests use a sophisticated mocking strategy with `patch()` decorators for authentication, configuration, and post services. You SHOULD follow this exact pattern for consistency.

*   **Note:** Both existing test files create temporary project directories with proper content structure (templates, config files). You MUST replicate this pattern to ensure your tests have the required templates and configuration.

*   **Warning:** The authentication middleware and CSRF protection are active in the test environment. Ensure your test requests include proper CSRF tokens and use the authenticated_client fixture for protected routes.

*   **Critical:** The existing `test_dashboard.py` file has 607 lines and covers basic functionality. You need to EXTEND this file to meet the >80% coverage requirement and add missing test scenarios.

*   **Security:** All API endpoints require CSRF tokens. Your form submission tests MUST include `csrf_token: "test-csrf-token"` in the data payload.

*   **Mocking Strategy:** The tests mock these key components:
    - `microblog.server.routes.dashboard.get_post_service()` for post operations
    - `microblog.auth.jwt_handler.verify_jwt_token()` for authentication
    - `microblog.server.middleware.get_csrf_token()` for CSRF tokens
    - Configuration manager to avoid file system dependencies

*   **Template Requirements:** Both test files create minimal HTML templates in the temporary directory. You MUST ensure all dashboard templates are created for routes to render properly.

*   **Coverage Gaps:** The current `test_dashboard.py` covers basic scenarios but may need additional tests for:
    - Error handling edge cases
    - Complex form validation scenarios
    - Complete user workflows from login through post management
    - HTMX-specific functionality if implemented
    - Performance under load

*   **Pattern Compliance:** Follow the exact fixture naming and setup patterns from existing files:
    - `temp_project_dir()` for directory structure
    - `authenticated_client()` and `unauthenticated_client()` for test clients
    - Mock objects with proper `.return_value` and `.side_effect` configurations
