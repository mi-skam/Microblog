# Code Refinement Task

The previous code submission did not pass verification. You must fix the following issues and resubmit your work.

---

## Original Task Description

Create end-to-end tests for complete user workflows including authentication, post creation with images, live preview, publishing, and build processes.

**Agent Type Hint:** TestingAgent
**Target Files:** ["tests/e2e/test_complete_workflows.py", "tests/e2e/test_htmx_interactions.py"]
**Deliverables:** End-to-end test suite covering complete user workflows and HTMX functionality
**Acceptance Criteria:** Complete user journeys tested, HTMX interactions verified, image upload workflows tested, build process integration tested, test coverage comprehensive

---

## Issues Detected

### Test Failures (31 out of 36 tests failing)
*   **Template Error:** Multiple tests failing with `TemplateNotFound` error for `dashboard/home.html` and other templates. The minimal templates created in fixtures are not being found by the Jinja2 template loader.
*   **Import Module Error:** Tests failing with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'microblog.server.routes.dashboard'` - indicates routing module imports are failing.
*   **App Creation Issues:** The `create_app()` function is failing due to missing dependencies and configuration issues, causing tests to fall back to minimal FastAPI app.
*   **Service Mocking Issues:** Service injection and mocking patterns are not working correctly - services like `get_post_service`, `get_image_service`, etc. are not being properly mocked.
*   **Authentication Middleware Problems:** The authentication patches are not working correctly, causing 404 errors instead of successful authenticated responses.

### Linting Errors (9 total)
*   **Unused Import F401:** `unittest.mock.AsyncMock` imported but unused in `test_complete_workflows.py:11`
*   **Unused Import F401:** `urllib.parse.parse_qs` imported but unused in `test_complete_workflows.py:12`
*   **Unused Import F401:** `urllib.parse.urlparse` imported but unused in `test_complete_workflows.py:12`
*   **Unused Variable F841:** Local variable `e` assigned but never used in multiple exception handlers
*   **Missing Newline W292:** No newline at end of both test files
*   **Import Organization I001:** Import block is un-sorted in `test_htmx_interactions.py:353`

### Structural Issues
*   **Missing Template Registration:** The temporary templates created in fixtures are not being registered with the Jinja2 environment properly.
*   **Service Import Paths:** The mock patches are using incorrect import paths that don't match the actual application structure.
*   **HTMX Endpoint Testing:** Many HTMX-specific endpoints return 404 errors, indicating the actual API routes may not exist or are at different paths.

## Best Approach to Fix

You MUST fix the E2E tests by addressing the fundamental application integration issues:

1. **Fix Template Loading:**
   - Configure the FastAPI app's Jinja2Templates to use the temporary template directory from fixtures
   - Ensure template inheritance and path resolution works correctly
   - Verify all required templates (base, dashboard/home, dashboard/post_edit, etc.) exist

2. **Fix Service Mocking:**
   - Use correct import paths for service mocking (check actual codebase structure)
   - Ensure service factory functions are properly mocked before app creation
   - Fix dependency injection patterns to work with the actual application architecture

3. **Fix Authentication Integration:**
   - Properly mock authentication middleware at the correct points in the request lifecycle
   - Ensure CSRF token generation and validation is mocked consistently
   - Use the authentication patterns established in existing integration tests

4. **Fix HTMX API Routes:**
   - Verify the actual HTMX API endpoint paths in the codebase
   - Ensure tests target existing endpoints or mock them appropriately
   - Test actual HTML fragment responses with proper HTMX attributes

5. **Fix Linting Issues:**
   - Remove unused imports: `AsyncMock`, `parse_qs`, `urlparse`
   - Remove unused exception variables or use them appropriately
   - Add newlines at end of files
   - Fix import organization by moving inline imports to the top

6. **Improve Test Reliability:**
   - Use more robust fixture setup that mirrors the actual application configuration
   - Add proper error handling that doesn't mask real issues
   - Ensure tests can run independently without cross-test dependencies

The tests should demonstrate complete user workflows while being resilient to configuration and dependency issues. Focus on testing the workflow logic and service interactions rather than full stack integration if the application setup continues to be problematic.
