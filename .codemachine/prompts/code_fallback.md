# Code Refinement Task

The previous code submission did not pass verification. You must fix the following issues and resubmit your work.

---

## Original Task Description

Create integration tests for dashboard functionality including authentication flows, post management operations, and form submissions. Test complete user workflows.

**Agent Type Hint:** TestingAgent
**Inputs:** Dashboard implementation, user workflow requirements, integration testing patterns
**Target Files:** ["tests/integration/test_dashboard.py", "tests/integration/test_auth_flows.py"]
**Deliverables:** Integration test suite for dashboard functionality and user workflows
**Acceptance Criteria:** All dashboard routes tested, authentication flows verified, form submissions tested, user workflows covered, test coverage >80%

---

## Issues Detected

*   **Test Failure:** The test case `test_unauthenticated_access_protection` in `tests/integration/test_dashboard.py` is failing due to an exception in the FastAPI middleware stack when testing unauthenticated access.
*   **Test Failure:** The test case `test_post_service_error_handling_integration` in `tests/integration/test_dashboard.py` is failing due to improper error handling when the post service is unavailable.
*   **Test Failure:** The test case `test_auth_route_coverage` in `tests/integration/test_auth_flows.py` is failing because the logout template (`auth/logout.html`) is missing from the test template creation.
*   **Coverage Issue:** Current test coverage is only 24%, significantly below the required >80% coverage. The tests need to be enhanced to cover more of the codebase functionality.

## Best Approach to Fix

You MUST fix these specific issues:

1. **Fix Missing Logout Template:** Add the missing `auth/logout.html` template in the `_create_auth_templates` method in `tests/integration/test_auth_flows.py` to resolve the template not found error.

2. **Fix Unauthenticated Access Test:** Modify the `test_unauthenticated_access_protection` test in `tests/integration/test_dashboard.py` to properly handle the middleware configuration for testing unauthenticated access without causing exceptions.

3. **Fix Error Handling Test:** Fix the `test_post_service_error_handling_integration` test to properly mock service failures and handle the expected error responses.

4. **Enhance Test Coverage:** The current tests only achieve 24% coverage but need >80%. You must add more comprehensive tests that cover:
   - More authentication middleware scenarios
   - CSRF protection edge cases
   - Complete form submission workflows
   - Database interaction scenarios
   - Template rendering edge cases
   - Error handling for various failure modes

Focus on expanding test scenarios while maintaining the existing comprehensive test structure. The current tests are well-designed but need broader coverage to meet the acceptance criteria.
